# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of the Project

### Purpose
W. Avy is a financial investor interested in funding the creation of a new ice-cream surf shop on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The purpose of this analysis is to study the weather data provided in the SQLite file and predict whether the temperature will fluctuate significantly enough to influence the business of the ice-cream surf shop. 

## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software used: Python, Pandas, JSON, Jupyter Notebook and SQLite

## Results
The tables below display the summary statistics of the temperatures in June and the tempratures in December.

1)	On average, temperatures in June are higher (74.94°F) than temperatures in December (71.04°F) by 3 degrees. 
2)	The lowest temperature in December is lower (56°F) than the lowest temperature in June (64°F) by 8 degrees.
3)	The highest temperature in June is only slightly higher (85°F) than the highest temperature in December (83°F) by 2 degrees.

## Summary
Overall, there are no significant weather fluctuations between the temperature of Oahu during the month of June when compared to the temperature in the month of December. I’d imagine the biggest issues for the business would be reflected in the sale of ice cream during the lowest temperature drops in December (56°F). Otherwise, it is safe to assume that investing in the surf shop remains a lucrative venture for investor W. Avy.
